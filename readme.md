## Features

- four animated UFO buttons
- unique sounds for each button when pressed
- instructions modal
- play with mouse or keyboard keys
- timeout if player is too slow to push a button (10 seconds)
- no sequence length limit - keep playing until incorrect/timeout

## Technologies

- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
